# Accordion
Welcome one and all to my accordion. With this exercise I took it upon myself to create something as thorough and as close to the original presented as I possibly could, in both form and function. A process that I found both a little frustrating (which is a great motivator for me) and thoroughly enjoyable. I have also put together this little write up where I will talk about my methodology aswell as the technologies and my thought process whilst navigating the obstacles in this fun challenge.

# UX

## User goals
- As a user I want to look at and insantly recognise that the accordion is an interactive object
- I want my curser to change to pointer as I hover over each tab.
- I want to recognise the plus signs as an indication that interacting with the tab will reveal the answer.
- I want each tab to open correctly upon click
- I want previous tabs to close in the accordion when a new one is pressed. 
- I expect the information found within the accordion to be relevant to me and common place enough to be part of an F.A.Q

## Site owner goals
- As a Site owner I want my accordion to be legible.
- I want the stylings to be clear and elements to be defined.
- I want the design to be intuitive and my use of colour and padding/margin to define each individual element
- I want my accordion to work on both mobile and desktop devices and for the design to suit accordingly
- I want the transitions and animations between tabs to be responsive accross all devices. 
- I want the transitions to run smoothly
- I want the user to be able to retain frequently asked information to reduce stressload on my Customer service team.

## Fonts
Finding the correct font to match the example given was one of the most fun parts of this challenge. I really revelled in the minutiae of looking through google fonts and comparing the tail ends of *a* or the curve of the letter *e* until I found the Heebo and Monsterrat pairing. The former was used for the title and h3 elements with the latter being reserved for content. I knew instantly that I was dealing with a font in the 'Sans-serif' family so that helped rule out a lot of unnecessary options. 
I used google fonts to then judge the font weight and applied their CDN link to my index page.
